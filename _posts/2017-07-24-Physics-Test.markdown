<!--My boss has been away for a couple of weeks and I'm in that weird limbo between the completion of a project and the beginning of another one. Uncertain about what to do next and somewhat bored to even start thinking. So I figured that all I needed was some good old ego boost.-->

<!--The community of physicists to which I belong to, high energy physics, is somewhat small and peculiar. Our job is to develop new ideas and write papers about them. The new ideas we try to develop are about Nature, trying to understand and explain the way it works at the most fundamental level.-->
<!---->
<!--The papers we write are usually published on scientific journal like in any other scientific field. What is peculiar about high energy physics is that nobody really cares about scientific journals and to make our ideas immediately accessible as they are in final form the [arXiv] was created (in the beginning of the nineties). When a paper of mine is ready I would just post it there for anybody to read it. For free.-->
<!---->
<!--The [arXiv] is divided in many categories depending on the discipline. All my papers are in two of them [hep-ph] and [hep-th], standing for High Energy Physics - Phenomenology and Theory.-->
<!---->
<!--The arXiv did not exist when [Steven Weinberg] wrote his most cited and Nobel worth paper, [A Model of Leptons], so you will not find it there. Luckily there is another online tool which is bread and butter for high energy physicist, which allows you to search for every single paper ever written by the community. This is the [INSPIRE] database.-->
<!---->
<!--INSPIRE periodically upload a [screenshot] of the whole high energy physics production (and more) in XML form. Every paper and author is assigned a unique identifier. The database contains information about each paper, like title, abstract, date of appearance in any form, arXiv identifier (if it applies), and so on. An almost complete description-->
